// The CI fast clock (issue #543): the one place that reads CI_FAST. With CI_FAST=1 the checks scale the real-time
// waits they depend on (grace periods, settle sleeps, mock table windows) down tenfold; without it every
// value is returned unchanged. Only the check scripts import this: the game, the relay and the runners never do,
// so play always runs at real timing. A scheduled/manual CI run leaves CI_FAST unset to exercise real timing.
