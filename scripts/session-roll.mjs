// Keeping Claude sessions small (issue #787). An Agent SDK session grows with every turn and is resent on every model call.
// Claude Haiku 5.5 bills a request by its prompt length, all input tokens counted (uncached, cache reads, cache writes): past
// ROLL.LINE every rate is 5x (read 2026-11-04 from the pricing page, "Long context pricing"; no other current model has such a
// line). The SDK left alone compacts near the 1M window, 967k on Haiku, so a long-lived session lives its whole life past it.
//
// Two levers, both between the runner and the SDK, no game state:
//   the roll     the main one. Between turns, when the last call's prompt reached the seat's roll point, the session file is set
//                aside in logs/agents/old/ and the next turn starts a fresh SDK session. Standing orders (with YOUR PERSONA), runner
//                settings, turn count and spend stay on the session object; the hero's memory is in the game (journal, notebook,
//                persona) and the first turn after a roll is told to read it. Never inside a turn, never with a scene open or
//                due, never on a reflection turn (it needs the day it reflects on). The claim and the pacer are not touched.
// A fresh session asked from the page reaches the runner as a "fresh" line on stdin (askFresh) and rolls by the same rules.
//   compaction   the net, for one very long turn or a roll held back by a scene. CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW through query()'s
//                env (read by the CLI; `npm run sessioncheck` proves it on the real binary). The CLI's threshold is the window less
//                20k of output room less 13k of buffer, so a window of roll + NET compacts 7k above the roll point: the roll,
//                which never touches a scene, goes first, and compaction still fires before ROLL.LINE.
// Plain Node, no SDK import.
